        <p>It&rsquo;s not a big surprise that this year came with difficulties of all kinds, but still came with opportunities as well.</p>
<p>This year I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to finish college, graduate and get a job, all from the comfort of home. Personally this is one of the reason I’ve choose this career, it can give all the opportunities you want, but you have to focus and do things in order to go somewhere.</p>
<p>Work from home is something that I&rsquo;ve always wanted to give a try, because you focus on the important stuff that actually make things happen and for sure this year did make it easy for this. Even better, seems like work from home came to stay. People will start to focus on what really matters to achieve things and that&rsquo;s good for everyone.</p>
<p>But this doesn&rsquo;t not mean that I hate traveling nor go out for a walk, I&rsquo;m just selective about everything  I can choose in this life.</p>

<p>One of the things I feel grateful for this year is that I&rsquo;ve learnt to focus on things, people and projects that inspire me to be better everyday, in any way.</p>
<p>Time ago, I was struggling to be around these kind of people, but since the begninning of this year I&rsquo;ve started to connect with these people thanks to projects and similar objectives.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that you have to work on things you enjoy and be skilled at it because the correct people will come to you naturally.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not always good moments.</p>
<p>This year I were accepted in Google Summer of Code and I failed, but the worst thing it made me feel was that I punished myself instead of forgiving myself and keep trying. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t  touch the keyboard for long enough to forget some other skills. This feeling is the worst.</p>
<p>This experience made me humble and realistic about me.</p>
<p>Eventually, I&rsquo;ve learnt to forgive my self, to make mistakes and keep trying. For sure, once you overcome that feeling it easy to say, but it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s a whole process to forgive yourself, accept the mistakes and learn from them. By fortune, this year did make it easy for this.</p>

<p>As the year were continue, I worked on some projects that helped me on a variety of ways, I&rsquo;ve meet new friends and new opportunities came around.</p>
<p>On <strong>February</strong> I&rsquo;ve helped <a href="https://github.com/da-edra">Andrea Gómez</a> to give the first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/es/Open-SOurce-Mexico-OSOM/events/268481089/">Arch Linux Contribution talk</a>.</p>
<p>On <strong>May</strong> I was accepted on Google Summer Of Code to work on <a href="https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf">The Update Framework</a> project. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/SantiagoTorres">Santiago Torres-Arias</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lukpueh">Lukas Pühringer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trishankatdatadog">Trishank Karthik Kuppusamy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JustinCappos">Professor Justin Cappos</a> for your time and attention, I&rsquo;m sorry that I didn&rsquo;t made it but still I learned a lot. Thanks!</p>
<p>On <strong>July</strong> I finished college, worked on <a href="https://github.com/osstecmm/matefacil-demo">MateFacil</a> and <a href="https://github.com/osstecmm">Grupo de Desarrollo de Software Libre del Tecnológico Mario Molina</a>, projects that now are currently helping the academic community of the campus.</p>
<p>On <strong>August</strong> started <a href="https://t.me/techntalks">Tech Talks</a> alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/mxarc">Alfonso Reyes</a>, a community to learn and improve the English language by talking with others, for free. Also, I attended the Tomato Valley and Supercívico&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/supercivicosmx/status/1285378675693813760?s=20">Hackathon</a> alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/villanomas">Edwin Villa</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eriko13">Erik German</a>.</p>
<p>On <strong>October</strong> I&rsquo;ve helped to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4KpbdGiwtk">the Arch Linux Contribution WorkShop</a> at <a href="https://ccoss.org">CCOSS</a> and helped to start the <a href="https://t.me/archlinuxmx">Mexican Arch Linux community</a>.</p>
<p>On <strong>November</strong> I got a job at <a href="https://blits.net">Blits Labs</a>. I&rsquo;m learning new stuff. I&rsquo;ll talk more about this in a near future.</p>
<p>On <strong>December</strong> Linuxeros Zapopan did the first <a href="https://youtu.be/_xfMfBE0Rzw">YouTube Live transmission</a> and helped to the <a href="https://twitter.com/gdldevcomms/status/1334936973535027210?s=20">PosaDev</a> event by sharing the events to the community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy that things turned well just in time for the new year coming and I just want to say, thanks.</p>
<p>Thanks to all people that helped me achieve new things and the time well spended on it.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m aware thanks to all of the lessons learned this year I&rsquo;ll focus on achieve new goals and connect with new people.</p>
